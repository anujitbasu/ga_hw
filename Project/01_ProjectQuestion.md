**What is the question you hope to answer?**

Given some attributes of an in-progress taxi ride, and a polyline of its current path, is it possible to predict the destination of the taxi ride?

**Why did you select this question?**

I could not get data directly connected to my workplace for a class project. And since I am interested in a general exposure to 
Machine Learning algorithms, I decided to looks for a problem and dataset of a general interest. While perusing various open 
and closed competitions on Kaggle, I stumbled upon this closed competition.
